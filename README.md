This repo is an example of building an FNA game using .NET Core 3, including
steps for code signing and notarization of the app. While this is using FNA the
general approach should work fine for any .NET Core 3 app.

The game code contains some logic to show how you can configure the
`RootDirectory` for the `ContentManager`. Everything else interesting is in the
`FNADotNetCoreExample/FNADotNetCoreExample.csproj` file.

## ðŸš¨ Warning ðŸš¨

This is a work in progress to explore a reasonable build and publish pattern for
developing apps with .NET Core 3, specifically looking at games made using the
FNA framework. It is not necessarily complete and I've not yet verified the
outputs on all platforms, nor submitted games to Apple Mac App Store.

What I'm saying is there might be bugs or gaps. If you find them, please feel
free to submit PRs or report issues.

# Building and running

I'm sure Visual Studio works fine but I'm using a Mac so I'm in the Terminal:

```sh
dotnet run -p FNADotNetCoreExample
```

That'll take care of building and copying the correct fnalibs into the output
directory along with actually starting up the game.

# Publishing

Generally speaking you just use `dotnet publish` to publish the various
platforms. Something like this produces [self-contained
builds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/index#self-contained-deployments-scd)
for each target platform.

```sh
dotnet publish FNADotNetCoreExample \
  -c Release \
  -r linux-x64 \
  -o path/to/publish/linux-x64

dotnet publish FNADotNetCoreExample \
  -c Release \
  -r osx-x64 \
  -o path/to/publish/osx-x64

dotnet publish FNADotNetCoreExample \
  -c Release \
  -r win-x64 \
  -o path/to/publish/win-x64

dotnet publish FNADotNetCoreExample \
  -c Release \
  -r win-x86 \
  -o path/to/publish/win-x86
```

You should publish each platform to separate directories or you'll stomp on
common named files.

Of sad note it [doesn't look](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/9265)
like prebuilt binaries exist for x86 Linux otherwise you'd have `linux-x86` in
there, too. You'd also need to add `linux-x86` to the `RuntimeIdentifiers`
property in the csproj file. The project should handle finding the right
`fnalibs` for x86 Linux once you do that.

## macOS

### Code signing

The project supports code signing for you if you are publishing on a Mac and
provide a `MacOSCodeSignIdentity` property. You can pass it on the command line:

```sh
dotnet publish FNADotNetCoreExample \
  -c Release \
  -r osx-x64 \
  -o path/to/publish/osx-x64 \
  "/p:MacOSCodeSignIdentity=\"Your Certificate Name\""
```

or add it to a `PropertyGroup` in your project file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <MacOSCodeSignIdentity>Your Certificate Name</MacOSCodeSignIdentity>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If you publish for macOS from Windows or Linux, or simply want to sign the code
yourself, you can always take the resulting app bundle and sign it on macOS
using this command:

```sh
codesign \
  -s "Your Certificate Name" \
  --entitlements FNADotNetCoreExample/macOS/Publish.entitlements \
  --force \
  --deep \
  --verbose \
  --options runtime \
  path/to/publish/osx-x64/FNADotNetCoreExample.app
```

This signs the app using the hardened runtime, and the entitlements tell the
system that we're going to be using a JIT compiler.

### Notarization

Once you've signed the app using the project or the `codesign` tool you can
submit for notarization. First you need to ZIP up the app bundle:

```sh
zip -r \
  path/to/publish/osx-x64/FNADotNetCoreExample.zip \
  path/to/publish/osx-x64/FNADotNetCoreExample.app
```

Then you can use existing Xcode tools to [submit for notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow?language=objc#3087734):

```sh
xcrun altool \
  --notarize-app \
  --primary-bundle-id com.example.fnadotnetcoreexample \
  --username <username> \
  --password <password> \
  --file path/to/publish/osx-x64/FNADotNetCoreExample.zip
```

That will print out a RequestUUID. You can use that to query for notarization
status:

```sh
xcrun altool \
  --notarization-info <RequestUUID> \
  --username <username> \
  --password <password>
```

When the status for the request is complete you can then staple the results to
the app file:

```sh
xcrun stapler staple path/to/publish/osx-x64/FNADotNetCoreExample.app
```
